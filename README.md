Simple pygame implementation of a well known game usually played on paper - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_soccer. The goal of the project was to create a game with pygame and make the code cleaner, more readable and structured better in comparison to my first python game, space robots (https://github.com/mmajchrzak557/space-robots).
